# Naive Bayes Classifier:
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset from the UCI machine learning repository is a study of classification of 568 patients that are labelled as either (M) Malignant of (B)Benign based on 30 attributes/features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate of a breast mass. The Naive Bayes Classifier is a supervised learning algorithm that will be used to classify & test the performance of this model. 70% of the data will be reserved for training and the remaining 30% will be used for testing.

## üìà Results:

* The Naive Bayes classifier demonstrated strong performance when applied to the UCI machine learning breast cancer data. With a true positive value of 111, a false positive value of 1, true negative value of 52, and a false negative value of 7, the classifier exhibited a high sensitivity of 94.06% as well as a high specificity of 98.11%. 

* With a sensitivity rate of 94.06%, the Naive Bayes classifier demonstrates a high ability to correctly identify true positive cases, i.e. patients who have been classified as having malignant tumors. A high sensitivity rate is desirable as it indicates a low rate of false negatives, emphasizing the classifier's effectiveness in capturing positive instances. 

* The specificity rate of 98.11% indicates that the Naive Bayes classifier is highly proficient at correctly identifying true negative cases. i.e. patients who have benign tunors. A high specificity rate implies a low rate of false positives, underlining the classifier's precision in identifying negative instances. 

* The overall model accuracy, which is calculated at 95.32%, suggests that the Naive Bayes classifier performs exceptionally well on the breast cancer dataset. This additionally suggests the effectiveness of the Naive Bayes classifier in differentiating between malignant and benign cases.
