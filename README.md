# Naive Bayes Classifier:
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset from the UCI machine learning repository is a study of classification of 568 patients that are labelled as either (M) Malignant of (B)Benign based on 30 attributes/features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate of a breast mass. The Naive Bayes Classifier is a supervised learning algorithm that will be used to classify & test the performance of this model. 70% of the data will be reserved for training and the remaining 30% will be used for testing. For model evaluation a Confusion Matrix was created to determine models sensitivity and specifity. Overall model accuracy was 95.3% - model performed exceptoinally well at classifying which patients were Malignant or Benign.
